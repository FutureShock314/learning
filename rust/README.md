use `./run` or `cargo run` to run code <br />
preferably use `cargo run`
<br />

`cargo build --release` builds with optimisations, takes longer but end binary runs faster, located in `./target/release` instead of `./target/debug`

<br /> <br />
use `cargo check` to check code syntax but not compile ( faster )
